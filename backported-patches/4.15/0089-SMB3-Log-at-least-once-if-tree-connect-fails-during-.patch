Subject: [PATCH 089/267] SMB3: Log at least once if tree connect fails during
 reconnect

Adding an extra debug message to show if a tree connect failure during
reconnect (and made it a log once so it doesn't spam the logs).
Saw a case recently where tree connect repeatedly returned
access denied on reconnect and it wasn't as easy to spot as it
should have been.
