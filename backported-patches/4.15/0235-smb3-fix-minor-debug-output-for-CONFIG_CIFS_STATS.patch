Subject: [PATCH 235/328] smb3: fix minor debug output for CONFIG_CIFS_STATS

CONFIG_CIFS_STATS is now always enabled (to simplify the
code and since the STATS are important for some common
customer use cases and also debugging), but needed one
minor change so that STATS shows as enabled in the debug
output in /proc/fs/cifs/DebugData, otherwise it could
get confusing with STATS no longer showing up in the
"Features" list in /proc/fs/cifs/DebugData when basic
stats were in fact available.
