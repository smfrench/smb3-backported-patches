Subject: [PATCH 327/328] cifs: don't dereference smb_file_target before null
 check

There is a null check on dst_file->private data which suggests
it can be potentially null. However, before this check, pointer
smb_file_target is derived from dst_file->private and dereferenced
in the call to tlink_tcon, hence there is a potential null pointer
deference.

Fix this by assigning smb_file_target and target_tcon after the
null pointer sanity checks.

Detected by CoverityScan, CID#1475302 ("Dereference before null check")

Fixes: 04b38d601239 ("vfs: pull btrfs clone API to vfs layer")
