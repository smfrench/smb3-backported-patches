Subject: [PATCH 267/267] smb3: fix lease break problem introduced by
 compounding

Fixes problem (discovered by Aurelien) introduced by recent commit:
commit b24df3e30cbf48255db866720fb71f14bf9d2f39
("cifs: update receive_encrypted_standard to handle compounded responses")

which broke the ability to respond to some lease breaks
(lease breaks being ignored is a problem since can block
server response for duration of the lease break timeout).
