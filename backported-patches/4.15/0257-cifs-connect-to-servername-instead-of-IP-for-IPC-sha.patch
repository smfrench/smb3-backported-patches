Subject: [PATCH 257/328] cifs: connect to servername instead of IP for IPC$
 share
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This patch is required allows access to a Microsoft fileserver failover
cluster behind a 1:1 NAT firewall.

The change also provides stronger context for authentication and share
connection (see MS-SMB2 3.3.5.7 and MS-SRVS 3.1.6.8) as noted by
Tom Talpey, and addresses comments about the buffer size for the UNC
made by Aur√©lien Aptel.
