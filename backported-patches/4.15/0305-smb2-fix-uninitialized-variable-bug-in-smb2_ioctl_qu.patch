Subject: [PATCH 305/328] smb2: fix uninitialized variable bug in
 smb2_ioctl_query_info

There is a potential execution path in which variable *resp_buftype*
is passed as an argument to function free_rsp_buf(), in which it is
used in a comparison without being properly initialized previously.

Fix this by initializing variable *resp_buftype* to CIFS_NO_BUFFER
in order to avoid unpredictable or unintended results.

Addresses-Coverity-ID: 1473971 ("Uninitialized scalar variable")
Fixes: c5d25bdb2967 ("cifs: add IOCTL for QUERY_INFO passthrough to userspace")
